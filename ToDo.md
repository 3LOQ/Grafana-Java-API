# TODO
* Create not "Implemented" Methodes
* Integrate missing Grafana API (Config, Templates, Respones and Methodes)
* Perhaps use JSON Schema for "Config" POJO's to reduce duplicates
* Improve Method design
  * There are more or less 4 types of API requests which could be handeld in seperate methods (Currently for each method)
  * Implement an appropriate exception handling (currently through `null`)
* ...
